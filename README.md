# Shopping Cart 

This code was developed for training reasons as part of the course 'Modern JavaScript' on Udemy.
In this code I add some events with JavaScript such as adding courses to the cart and removing them,
accesing the document by transversing the DOM, get and create nodes.

Also used Local Storage for this one.
